                         <h3>Style insipred by Fashion week</h3>
                         <p>Paris has been ruling the high seas of fashion for more than three centuries.
                             During this time it has attracted the world’s foremost designers and seemingly imbued its citizens with an innate sense of style.
                             For these, and plenty of other reasons, Paris can still rightly claim its title of world fashion capital.
                             French girl style is stylish, simple, and chic, and it's all about the basics. Simplicity is key to the French style.
                             ... French girls are never overdone or overdress.
                             Instead, French style is all about effortless basic clothes with one statement piece like a scarf, a hat, or a great pair of shoes. </p>

                    <h3>Street Style</h3>
                    <p>Fashion is a forever thing thta people take pride in.Streetwear is a common term often thrown around without much thought to what it really means, what its values are, or where it comes from. Many genres of fashion can be defined with a general understanding and consensus that most of us subscribe to. It isn’t too difficult to separate luxury from high-street, bespoke from fast-fashion, formal-wear from leisure-wear. But fashion genres that are not made for the consumer rather curated and developed by the consumer, can sometimes be hard to define. </p>
